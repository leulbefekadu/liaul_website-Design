   <div id="part1">
    In this time my goal is to get a good grade because to get the department that i want i need to get enough score to get into it By the way i am not interested to stay here that mean in eiabc ,and to learn here, i am here because of my mistake when i fill the department choice and i tried to correct it but the registrar workers told me it is impossible to correct because it is too late to do so.
    <br><br><br>
  
    There is unconfirmed news that it is able to change department but if it is possible i am decided to change into computer science because it is my ambition i am passionate to learn programming and i will try upto end to join computer science i don't be hopless to get into it.But if i couldn't get computer science i will join architectural science architecture is my second choice next to computer science.
    since i started learning computer programming i know many things like , creating html document,styling html documents by css, inserting ordered, unordered and definition lists to an html.if you know something in programming you get so interested and after all my goal to join computer science is getting greater and greater.
